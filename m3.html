            <h4>Cappuccino</h4>
            <p class="description">This classic beverage is built upon a foundation of a rich double shot of espresso, topped with equal parts steamed milk and a thick, velvety layer of frothed milk foam. A true Italian cappuccino is defined by its "micro-foam"—bubbles so small they create a silky, marshmallow-like consistency that naturally sweetens the coffee's bold profile.</p>
