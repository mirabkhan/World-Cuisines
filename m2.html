            <h4>Ramune</h4>
            <p class="description">Famous for its unique "Codd-neck" glass bottle, this refreshing soda is sealed with a glass marble that you push down into a special chamber to release the fizz. With its bubbly personality and mild, fruity sweetness—traditionally a lemon-lime "bubblegum" flavor—it is a fun and interactive favorite for both children and adults alike.</p>

            <p class="description">These handcrafted treats feature a soft, chewy outer layer made from pounded glutinous rice (mochi), delicately dusted with cornstarch to prevent sticking.

            <p class="description">These skewered treats consist of three to five chewy rice flour dumplings that have been lightly grilled to create a subtle charred aroma and a slightly crisp exterior. They are generously glazed in a thick, translucent sweet-and-savory sauce made from a blend of soy sauce and sugar, offering a delightful contrast of textures and a rich umami finish.</p>
